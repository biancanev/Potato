# About SRC 3.1
### What is SRC 3.1?
SRC(Service Request Console) 3.1 is a platform that takes error in programs and analyzes the problem. Unlike HTTP error codes, these are much more simple and can be embedded in HTML. However, SRC 3.1 is not available for the public as it has a few kinks that have not been worked out.

SRC 3.1 was created by [http://thepotatoplace.ga/][The Potato Place Inc.]
