# About SRC 3.1
### What is SRC 3.1?
SRC(Service Request Console) 3.1 is a platform that takes error in programs and analyzes the problem. Unlike HTTP error codes, these are much more simple and can be embedded in HTML. However, SRC 3.1 is not available for the public as it has a few kinks that have not been worked out.

SRC 3.1 was created by [The Potato Place Inc.](http://thepotatoplace.ga/ "The Potato Place") and is in the process of being released to the public. Some BETA testings have already been done and there is a few more bugs to work out before it is released.
### How to use SRC 3.1?
SRC 3.1 uses the codes just as HTTP does. The full list of SRC codes are [here](https://github.com/biancanev/The-Potato-Place/blob/master/src/codes.md)
